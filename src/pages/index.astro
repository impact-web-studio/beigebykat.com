        This isn’t just about hair — it’s about how you feel walking out of the studio. At Beige by Kathy, every session
        is an intentional experience where your beauty, your story, and your time matter. I specialize in elevated,
        lived-in balayage — rich, dimensional colour that grows out effortlessly and complements your natural tones.
        Whether you’re coming in to refresh, reinvent, or reclaim a part of yourself, you’re in the right place.
